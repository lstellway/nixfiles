## NixOS host configurations

I am still learning how to use Nix (and flakes).

I intend to use Nix to manage my dotfiles and packages.. we'll see where this journey takes me.

### To do

- [ ] Configure git
- [ ] Configure vscode
- [ ] Install remaining applications
- [ ] Setup homebrew
- [ ] How to get Spotlight to index /run/current-system/Applications
  - [ ] @see https://github.com/NixOS/nix/issues/7055

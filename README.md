## NixOS host configurations

After dabbling with [Chezmoi](https://chezmoi.io), I am beginning to incorporate Nix into my workflow to manage dotfiles and machine configuration.

It was definitely a bit of a challenge to get started and accomplish what I was after, but I'm starting to get the hang of it and am pretty happy with the direction of my setup.

### Installation

**Darwin**

Initialize machine:
```
make darwin
```

Rebuild:
```
make darwin-rebuild
```

### To do

- [ ] Configure git
- [ ] SSH configuration
